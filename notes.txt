What is the Software develpment LifeCycle?


Name 3 Software Companies and give their software development lifecycle. 

Netflix
The software construction life cycle used at Netflix by the edge engineering team.
Netflix has used full-cycle development where the developers are responsible and take ownership of given aspects of service delivery such as deploying, monitoring, and maintaining the services they develop.
Here is the process:

Design. The developers actively contribute to the design process ensuring technical feasibility and user friendliness.
They work closely with the designers, product managers, and other involved parties to create a user-centric design.
They also carry out prototyping of designs while rotating on user feedback.

Development. They write, test, and debug code and use agile methodologies such as sprints and continuous Integration to allow them to have frequent releases.

Testing. In this software development cycle, the developers write unit tests to capture bugs early and improve code quality.
Testing is also incorporated into the Continuous Integration pipeline to prevent bugs from reaching production.

Deployment. Developers own the deployment process by managing infrastructure, pushing code to production environments, and carrying out frequent rollouts to deliver features faster.

Operations.  The developers also monitor and maintain the software in production, as well as identify and solve issues on time.

Support. In this development life cycle, developers go ahead to partake in customer support.
